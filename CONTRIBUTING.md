## Submitting new objects to the Menagerie
To make a submission, just make a pull request with the files you would like added in the folder of thee TTRPG it was designed for.
If it was not designed for a particular system then add it under the system agnostic folder.
Please make sure you follow any existing TEMPLATE.md for the system you're making a submission to.
If your submission could have a system agnostic version, you are encouraged to add it there as well but it's no required.
Finally make sure you add yourself to the [contributors section of the readme](https://github.com/LuiMoiPer/MagniloquentMagicalMenagerie#contributors), and thank you again for your submission!

## Adding a new TTRPG to the Menagerie
If your submission was designed for a particular TTRPG that does not have a directory in [menagerie](https://github.com/LuiMoiPer/MagniloquentMagicalMenagerie/tree/main/MagniloquentMagicalMenagerie), then please add the directory for the system and the edition the submission falls under.
There should be no spaces in the directory name(s) a the full system name should be used if possible.
Lastly you should also add a TEMPLATE.md file that builds off of [the system agnostic one](https://github.com/LuiMoiPer/MagniloquentMagicalMenagerie/blob/main/MagniloquentMagicalMenagerie/SystemAgnostic/TEMPLATE.md) and adds any relevant sections.
