# Bag of Hoarding
Rarity: Uncommon\
Requires Attunement: No\
Item Category: Wondrous Item

### Description
A canvas satchel that seems to be bursting at the seams.
When looking into the bag it seems to be filled with a random assortment of useless items.
And it seems like no character is ever able to pull items out of this bag.

### Effects
This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep.
The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet.
The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents.
Items can not be retrieved from this bag.

If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents appear clustered around the point it was destroyed.
If the bag is turned inside out, none of its contents spill and the current inside of the bag becomes the extra dimensional space.
Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.

Objects with extradimensional space can be placed inside the bag of hoarding like any other item, but a bag of hoarding can not be placed inside an extradimensional space.
Placing a bag of hoarding inside an extradimensional space created by a handy haversack, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane.
The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other.
Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes.
The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.
