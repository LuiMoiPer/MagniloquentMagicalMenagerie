# Ring of Holding
**Rarity**: Uncommon\
**Requires Attunement**: No\
**Item Category**: Ring

### Description
A simple band usually made of a common metal.
Some use this ring for silly things like convincing others that they've lost a finger, producing a seemingly endless stream of handkerchiefs, or dispensing small snacks.
Others use it to store small secret, personal, or useful items like notes, mementos, or lockpicks.

### Effects
This ring has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions.
The ring can hold up to 125 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet.
The ring weighs the same as a ring made of the same material, regardless of its contents.

Only one side of the ring serves as the opening to the extradimensional space, things passing through the other side pass through as normal.
Only things that you could pass through the ring's opening can be put into the ring.
It takes an action to remove something from the ring.
When removing something from the ring you can also cause the item to protrude up to an inch out of the ring's opening.
If the ring is broken, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane.

Placing a ring of holding inside an extradimensional space created by a handy haversack, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.
