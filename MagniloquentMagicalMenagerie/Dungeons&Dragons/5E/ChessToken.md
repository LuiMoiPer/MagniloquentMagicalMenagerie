# Chess Token
**Rarity**: Common\
**Requires Attunement**: No\
**Item Category**: Wondrous Item

### Description
A polished wooden token with the image of a chess peice on one side and a checkerboard pattern on the other.
The token may be made of any type of wood.

### Effects
As a bonus action, a creature can spend a chess token to move up to 40ft in the same manner as the chess piece depicted on the token.
Moving in this manner does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
The creature can also "capture" others in the same manner as the piece depicted on the token they spend.
If another creature is "captured" then it is swapped with the token user's initial location.
If the token used is the knight token, then it can use this movement to pass through solid objects.
