# Ring of Holding
### Description
A simple band usually made of a common metal.
Some use this ring for silly things like convincing others that they've lost a finger, producing a seemingly endless stream of handkerchiefs, or dispensing small snacks.
Others use it to store small secret, personal, or useful items like notes, mementos, or lockpicks.

### Effects
This ring is able to store objects into its own extradimensional space.
One side of the ring serves as the opening to the extradimensional space, and the obverse functions like a normal ring.
Only things that can fit through the diameter of the ring can be put into the pocket dimension.
No matter how many things get placed inside the extradimensional space, the ring's weight does not change.
When retrieving objects from the ring, you can make the item protrude up to on inch out of the pocket dimension's opening.
If the ring is ever broken, it vanishes and everything in the extradimensional space is lost.
