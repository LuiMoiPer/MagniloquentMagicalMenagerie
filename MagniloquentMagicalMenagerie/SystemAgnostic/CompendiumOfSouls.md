# Compendium Of Souls
### Description
A large tome bound in high quality leather and metal corner protectors that contains between 300 and 400 vellum pages.
The compendium has an aura that slightly draws in it's surroundings.
Each page holds an illustration of the soul that it contains.
These illustrations are magical and have the ability to move and speak.

### Effects
Whenever a sentient being dies within 100 feet of the compendium and there is an empty page within it, the being's soul is trapped in the next empty page.
Souls within the tome retain their knowledge and personality.
While the tome is open, the souls on the exposed pages can speak and perceive their surroundings.
If a page is removed from the compendium but not destroyed, any souls on the page can still perceive their surroundings and and speak.
If a page is destroyed, any souls contained on the page are released.
